I estimate that I had written about 3 million lines
of assembler code in my whole life. Now, code only
when strictly necessary.

Phi (golden ratio) is the approximate ratio between
two consecutive terms in a Fibonacci sequence.
The ratio between consecutive even terms approaches
phi^3 (4.236068) because each 3rd term is even.
Use a calculator and round the results to the nearest
integer when calculating the next terms:

2,8,34,.. multiplying by 4.236068 each time: 144,610,
2584,10946,46368,196418 & 832040

The sum is 1089154

My codeless regards,
Rudy.
