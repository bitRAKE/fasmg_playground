These files serve as constant definitions and not as documentation. Comments should mainly focus on the conversion/adaptation. Look elsewhere to understand the APIs. No attempt is made to support legacy interfaces or unused symbols.

Naming should migrate to parallel MS SDK names.

Presently there is no need to document functions as there is no type or parameter count checking.
