An open STRUC often presents as "undefined or out of scope" errors.


Technically syntacticals on the left side of /match/ are literal values - they just don't require quotes.




Proposed change:

	/iterate/ should ignore trailing comma

	iterate A,
	end iterate

	...would not loop with A="". To do that would require:

	iterate A,,
	end iterate

This change would follow list definitions in many other languages and parallels whitespace separated lists - trailing whitespace is not another item.

Present functionality has no way to iterate zero times without additional branching. Copy-Paste of lists always requires post paste editing when trailing item is modified.

/repeat/ instruction already follows a zero based pattern. So, this change would seem to align the functionality across fasmg.

How would it effect existing code? Only the empty case would need to be changed.
